# Theatre Ticket & Seating Management System
Hello! For this project I created a theater ticket and seating management system that can display, store, and update information about the price and availability of seats in a movie theatre.
Within theatre_tickets_functions.h, I explain what each function does.
The main program is theatre_tickets.cpp and it contains brief comments near the end explaining the menu options.
I had a great time creating this program and learning about functions!
